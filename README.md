# GitHub Battle. 

Practice on the react course from hillel. Allowed me to practice the main features of the react library.

Includes several sections. The general logic is as follows: in the battle component, you enter two GitHub account nicknames and then the functions compare them by stars, repositories, subscribers, and other parameters. At the end allows you to determine the winner.
